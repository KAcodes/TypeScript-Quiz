# TypeScript-Quiz
Quiz game created with TypeScript using OpenTDB API 

## Project Description

Having recently learnt TypeScript, I built this quiz to implement the skills I learned. The environment was configured using Vite and is built on React-TypeScript.
The app pulls data from a trivia database via an API call to populate the questions in the quiz. 

I worked on using conditional programming and setTimeout functions to smoothly render the next questions.
